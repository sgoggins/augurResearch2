# anomolyolly

Anomolyolly is a flutter application based on the augur dashboard to track the activity in different github repositories. The homepage for the dashboards is http://augur.chaoss.io. One example dashboard is included: http://augur.chaoss.io/repo/samples/react/overview

The goal of building this application was to learn flutter while working towards the goal of getting mobile notifications about these repositories if there is an anomoly. There are two flows supported by the app at the moment.

# New User

- App launched
- User enters email
- User creates login information 
- User continues to repository list page
- User selects repositories to watch
- User views selected repositories
- User logs out

# Existing user

- User enters email and password
- User continues to my repositories page
- User views already selected repositories
- User logs out
