# anomolyolly

Anomolyolly is a flutter application based on the augur dashboard to track the activity in different github repositories. The homepage for the dashboards is http://augur.chaoss.io. One example dashboard is included: http://augur.chaoss.io/repo/samples/react/overview

The goal of building this application was to learn flutter while working towards the goal of getting mobile notifications about these repositories if there is an anomoly. There are two flows supported by the app at the moment.
